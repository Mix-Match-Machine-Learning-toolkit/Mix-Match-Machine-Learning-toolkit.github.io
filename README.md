# Web interface - Mix & Match Machine Learning toolkit

The Mix & Match ML toolkit is a hybrid toolkit and consists of a sensing board with tangible tokens and the webinterface. The web interface can be found at <https://mixmatchmltoolkit.github.io/> 

We also provide open source instructions for making your own sensing board and tokens. Instructions for this can be found in the [DIY repository](https://github.com/MixMatchMLtoolkit/DIY-toolkit).
